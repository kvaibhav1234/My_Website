	<h2 style="text-align:right;"> INTRODUCTION </h2>
	<p style= "text-align:right;"> Hello, I am currently a rising junior at Rutgers University-New Brunswick majoring in Information Technology
								   and planning on minoring in Business Administration. I am curious and constantly looking for ways to improve my 
								   understanding of technology by learning more about it. My career goal is to improve the quality of human life by utilizing 
								   technology to take care of tedious and repetitive tasks so that people can have time for more meaningful moments in life. 
								   I am interested in exploring and learning about different fields in Information Technology through prospective internships and personal projects.

	<h2 style= "text-align:right;"> My Interest in Information Technology </h2>
</header>
	<p style= "text-align:right;"> My interest in Information Technology stems from my fascination with technology and how it advances. In this field, I 
										 believe that I can foster my understanding of different information systems and how they can be utilized and innovated. 
										 Additionally, the Information Technology field has different elements such as information security and technical support, 
										 both of which are fields that I have a current interest in. They also combine human interaction with technology in different ways. 
										 I believe that pursuing a career in this field will allow me to access the knowledge I need to in order to work and research in these 
										 fields and learn more about human-technology interactions.
